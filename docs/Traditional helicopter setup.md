# Traditional helicopter setup

## Disclaimer
We ported INAV on traditional helicopter for ourselves. Use it on your own risk! RC helicopter may be very dangerous. We suppose you know what you do. We mean that you are able to build, to configure and to fly RC helicopter without INAV or any other simillar products. According to laws of many countries RC model with autopilot may be consider as UAV. You are responsible of following your local laws.

If you are new to INAV, please read [Getting started](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Getting%20Started.md).

Please read [safety guide](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Safety.md) before turning on RC model.

Also we recomend you to read about [the board you own](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Boards.md).
Please make sure that your board supports as much [motors and servos](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/ESC%20and%20servo%20outputs.md) as you've got on your helicopter.

## Flashing INAV
Traditional helicopter supported by INAV started [firmware](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/releases) version 2.3.0.
1. Download [INAV configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator) for your OS.
2. Switch your board to DFU mode (board usualy has got a button for it or if there is already INAV, CleanFlight or BetaFlight on your board make CLI command "dfu")
